Images","description":"Open vBrowser (OvB) currently ships with a curated set of pre-built browser images designed to balance security, stability, and investigative capability.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"browsers/image-lifecycle":{"id":"browsers/image-lifecycle","title":"Image Lifecycle","description":"Open vBrowser (OvB) manages browser environments through a controlled image lifecycle that governs how browser images are selected, built, distributed, and executed. This lifecycle is designed to ensure repeatability, security, and minimal attack surface.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"browsers/supported-browsers":{"id":"browsers/supported-browsers","title":"Supported Browsers","description":"Open vBrowser (OvB) supports multiple browser environments, each packaged as an isolated container image. Browsers are treated as explicitly approved execution environments and must be selected during setup.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"getting-started/architecture":{"id":"getting-started/architecture","title":"Architecture","description":"Open vBrowser (OvB) is built as a cloud-native, container-first platform that combines local orchestration, automated infrastructure provisioning, and ephemeral browser workloads. Its architecture is designed to maximize isolation, repeatability, and operator control while minimizing long-lived state.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"getting-started/overview":{"id":"getting-started/overview","title":"Overview","description":"Open vBrowser (OvB) is a cloud-native, containerized browser isolation platform designed to allow analysts, investigators, and security teams to interact with untrusted web content without exposing their local system, identity, or network.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"getting-started/prerequisites":{"id":"getting-started/prerequisites","title":"Prerequisites","description":"Before deploying Open vBrowser (OvB), ensure that your environment meets all required technical, operational, and account prerequisites. OvB provisions real cloud infrastructure and is not a lightweight local-only application.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"getting-started/security-model":{"id":"getting-started/security-model","title":"Security Model","description":"Open vBrowser (OvB) is designed around a defense-in-depth security model that prioritizes isolation, ephemerality, and operator control. Rather than attempting to make browsing \\"safe\\" on an endpoint, OvB removes the endpoint from the threat path entirely.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"installation/aws":{"id":"installation/aws","title":"AWS Configuration","description":"Open vBrowser (OvB) relies on AWS to provide isolated, ephemeral compute infrastructure for browser execution and supporting services. This document explains how AWS is used, what permissions are required, and how to configure your account safely.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"installation/cloudflare":{"id":"installation/cloudflare","title":"Cloudflare Configuration","description":"Open vBrowser (OvB) requires Cloudflare to manage DNS records and provide origin shielding for backend services. Cloudflare acts as a protective boundary between the public internet and OvB\u2019s AWS infrastructure.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"installation/environment-variables":{"id":"installation/environment-variables","title":"Environment Variables","description":"Open vBrowser (OvB) uses environment variables as the single source of configuration truth across all components. All services consume the same .env file generated during setup.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"installation/script-setup":{"id":"installation/script-setup","title":"Setup Script","description":"The setup.sh script is the primary orchestration entry point for deploying Open vBrowser (OvB). It automates environment preparation, infrastructure provisioning, image management, and service startup.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"installation/teardown":{"id":"installation/teardown","title":"Teardown","description":"Open vBrowser (OvB) provides a controlled and repeatable teardown process to fully destroy all deployed infrastructure and services. Teardown is an intentional part of the security and operational lifecycle and should be used regularly.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"installation/terraform":{"id":"installation/terraform","title":"Terraform","description":"Open vBrowser (OvB) uses Terraform as the sole mechanism for provisioning and destroying cloud infrastructure. This ensures deployments are reproducible, auditable, and fully reversible.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"legal/commercial-use":{"id":"legal/commercial-use","title":"Commercial Use","description":"Open vBrowser (OvB) is released under a custom non-commercial license.

However, OvB is not an anonymity service and does not claim to provide absolute or guaranteed anonymity.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"security/cloud-isolation":{"id":"security/cloud-isolation","title":"Cloud Isolation","description":"Open vBrowser (OvB) relies on cloud-based isolation to separate analysts from hostile web content. Instead of attempting to secure browsers on endpoints, OvB moves browser execution into controlled, disposable cloud environments.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"security/limitations":{"id":"security/limitations","title":"Limitations","description":"Open vBrowser (OvB) is a powerful browser isolation platform, but it is not a universal security solution. Understanding its limitations is critical to using it safely, effectively, and responsibly.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"security/opsec-best-practices":{"id":"security/opsec-best-practices","title":"OPSEC Best Practices","description":"Operational Security (OPSEC) is the most critical factor in safely using Open vBrowser (OvB). OvB provides strong isolation and containment, but operator behavior ultimately determines attribution risk.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"usage/api":{"id":"usage/api","title":"API","description":"Open vBrowser (OvB) exposes a limited HTTP API used to create and manage browser sessions. The API functions as a control plane, not a data plane, and does not expose browser internals or browsing content.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"usage/clipboard":{"id":"usage/clipboard","title":"Clipboard","description":"Copy (Session \u2192 Device)","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"usage/file-management":{"id":"usage/file-management","title":"File Management","description":"Upload Files","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"usage/idle-timeouts":{"id":"usage/idle-timeouts","title":"Idle Timeouts","description":"Idle timeouts in Open vBrowser (OvB) are a core safety and cost-control mechanism.
